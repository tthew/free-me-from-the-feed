# FreeMeFromTheFeed - Facebook News Feed Blocker Chrome Extension

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

---

Rudimentary Chrome Extension to block the Facebook News Feed whilst attempting
to retain all other functionality unaffected.

Implemented with vanilla Javascript. Could be easily ported to other browsers or via extensions or Userscripts.

No maintenance intended. This was a quick pet project to scratch an itch. Source provided as-is. Bug reports and Pull Requests invited, but please don't expect anything to happen quickly or ever at all. Feel free to fork and self maintain.

Use at your own risk!
